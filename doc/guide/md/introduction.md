## Introduction

Menter is a programming language that is designed to be easy to learn and use.  
It is a dynamically typed language, which means that you don't have to specify the type of a variable.  
Menter is also a compiled language, which means that you have to compile your code before you can run it.  
This guide will teach you how to use Menter.
